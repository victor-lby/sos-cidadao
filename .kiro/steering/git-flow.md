# Git Flow & Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy

### Trunk-Based Development
The project follows a simplified trunk-based development model:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code, protected branch
- **Feature branches** - Short-lived branches for individual features/fixes
- **No long-lived development branches** - Features merge directly to main

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feat/feature-name          # New features
fix/bug-description        # Bug fixes
docs/documentation-update  # Documentation changes
refactor/code-improvement  # Code refactoring
test/test-improvements     # Test additions/improvements
chore/maintenance-task     # Maintenance tasks
```

### Branch Protection Rules
- **Main branch** requires:
  - Pull request reviews (minimum 1 approval)
  - Status checks must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
  - Up-to-date branches before merge
  - No direct pushes allowed

## Conventional Commits

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes
- **build**: Build system or external dependency changes

### Scope Examples
- **auth**: Authentication and authorization
- **notifications**: Notification workflow
- **api**: Backend API changes
- **frontend**: Frontend application changes
- **db**: Database schema or operations
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **infra**: Infrastructure and deployment

### Commit Message Examples
```bash
# Feature commits
feat(notifications): add notification approval endpoint
feat(auth): implement JWT token refresh mechanism
feat(frontend): add notification list component with pagination

# Bug fix commits
fix(api): resolve organization scoping in notification queries
fix(auth): handle expired JWT tokens gracefully
fix(frontend): correct HAL link rendering in data tables

# Documentation commits
docs(api): update OpenAPI specification for notification endpoints
docs: add deployment instructions for Vercel

# Refactoring commits
refactor(domain): extract notification validation to pure functions
refactor(services): improve MongoDB connection pooling

# Test commits
test(notifications): add integration tests for approval workflow
test(auth): add unit tests for permission aggregation

# Chore commits
chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
chore(ci): configure Dependabot for security updates
```

### Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope:
```bash
feat(api)!: change notification status enum values
fix(auth)!: modify JWT token structure for enhanced security
```

## Pull Request Workflow

### PR Creation Process
1. **Create feature branch** from latest main
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feat/notification-approval
   ```

2. **Make commits** following conventional commit format
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(notifications): implement approval endpoint with HAL links"
   ```

3. **Push branch** and create PR
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/notification-approval
   ```

4. **Create PR** using the provided template

### PR Requirements
- **Title** must follow conventional commit format
- **Description** must use the PR template
- **All CI checks** must pass
- **At least 1 approval** from code owner
- **Branch must be up-to-date** with main

### PR Merge Strategy
- **Squash and merge** for feature branches
- **Commit message** follows conventional commit format
- **Delete branch** after merge
