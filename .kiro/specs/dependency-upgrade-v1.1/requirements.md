# Requirements Document - Dependency Upgrade Initiative v1.1.0

## Introduction

This specification outlines the systematic approach to upgrading major dependencies that were deferred during the v1.0.0 release to maintain stability. The initiative focuses on modernizing the technology stack while preserving system functionality and ensuring comprehensive testing throughout the upgrade process.

The upgrade targets critical dependencies with major version changes that introduce new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements, while maintaining backward compatibility where possible and implementing necessary migration strategies where breaking changes are unavoidable.
