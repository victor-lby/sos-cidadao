# Requirements Document

## Introduction

S.O.S Cidad√£o is a public, open-source civic notification system designed for multi-tenant municipal operations. The platform enables municipal teams to receive, moderate, and broadcast critical public alerts through an auditable workflow. The system features a serverless Python backend with Flask, a Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 frontend, JWT authentication, HATEOAS Level-3 APIs using HAL, full observability via OpenTelemetry, Redis caching, MongoDB Atlas storage, and AMQP message queuing via LavinMQ. The platform is designed to deploy on Vercel by default with Docker support for local development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-tenant Organization Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage multiple municipal organizations within a single platform, so that each municipality can operate independently with isolated data and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new organization is created THEN the system SHALL store organization data with unique id, name, slug, timestamps, and schemaVersion
2. WHEN any data query is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically scope results to the authenticated user's organization
3. WHEN an organization is soft-deleted THEN the system SHALL set deletedAt timestamp and exclude it from default queries
4. IF a user attempts to access data from another organization THEN the system SHALL deny access and return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 2: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a municipal operator, I want to securely log in with role-based permissions, so that I can perform only the actions authorized for my role within my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL issue JWT access and refresh tokens
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL allow token refresh using a valid refresh token
3. WHEN a token is revoked THEN the system SHALL add it to Redis blocklist and reject subsequent requests using that token
4. IF a user lacks required permission for an action THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden with clear error message
5. WHEN a user is assigned roles THEN the system SHALL aggregate all permissions from those roles for authorization checks
6. WHEN JWT tokens are issued THEN the system SHALL include organizationId claim for multi-tenant scoping

### Requirement 3: Notification Intake via Webhook

**User Story:** As an external system integrator, I want to submit notifications via a secure webhook endpoint, so that alerts can be ingested into the moderation workflow.

5. WHEN notification data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with Pydantic validation errors

### Requirement 4: Notification Review and Moderation

**User Story:** As a municipal operator, I want to review incoming notifications and decide whether to approve or deny them, so that only verified alerts are dispatched to the public.
