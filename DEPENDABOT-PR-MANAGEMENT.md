# Dependabot PR Management Strategy

## Current Status
- **20 open Dependabot PRs** for dependency updates
- **All failing CI checks** (expected due to CI/CD setup timing)
- **Major version bumps** that may introduce breaking changes

## Analysis of Key Updates

### High-Risk Updates (Major Version Changes)
- `isort: 5.12.0 → 7.0.0` (Major version jump)
- `date-fns: 2.30.0 → 4.1.0` (Major version jump)
- `vite: 5.4.20 → 7.1.9` (Major version jump)
- `vitest: 0.34.6 → 3.2.4` (Major version jump)
- `typescript: 5.2.2 → 5.9.3` (Minor but significant)

### Recommended Action Plan

#### Phase 1: Close Risky PRs (Immediate)
Close PRs with major version bumps that could break the system:

```bash
# Close high-risk PRs
gh pr close 21 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
gh pr close 20 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
gh pr close 19 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
gh pr close 18 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
gh pr close 16 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
gh pr close 15 --comment "Closing due to major version bump. Will handle in dedicated update cycle."
```

#### Phase 2: Evaluate Safe Updates
Keep and potentially merge PRs with minor/patch updates that are likely safe.

#### Phase 3: Systematic Dependency Updates (Future)
Create a dedicated branch for dependency updates and test thoroughly.

## Immediate Recommendation

**Close all Dependabot PRs for now** and focus on the successful v1.0.0 release. Handle dependency updates in a controlled manner in v1.1.0.

### Rationale
1. **Release Stability**: v1.0.0 is working - don't risk breaking it
2. **Major Version Jumps**: Many updates are major versions with potential breaking changes
3. **Testing Required**: Dependency updates need thorough testing
4. **CI/CD Issues**: Current PRs have failing checks that need investigation

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Close All Dependabot PRs
```bash
for pr in {1..21}; do
  gh pr close $pr --comment "Closing Dependabot PR to maintain v1.0.0 stability. Dependency updates will be handled systematically in v1.1.0 development cycle."
done
```

### Step 2: Configure Dependabot for Future
Update `.github/dependabot.yml` to:
- Limit to patch and minor updates only
- Group related updates together
- Schedule updates weekly instead of daily

### Step 3: Plan v1.1.0 Dependency Update Cycle
- Create dedicated branch for dependency updates
- Update dependencies incrementally with testing
- Ensure CI/CD passes before merging
