### Deployment Process

#### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh

# Validate environment configuration
./scripts/load-env.sh production

# Test external service connections
python -c "
import pymongo
import redis
import pika
# Test connections with production credentials
"
```

#### 2. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Verify deployment
vercel ls
```

#### 3. Post-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Run production deployment validation
./scripts/validate-production-deployment.sh --url https://your-domain.vercel.app
